# Changes Summary - Bot Improvements

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Quick Replies Spam Fixed
**Problem:** "Please choose an option" showed after EVERY customer message/reply

**Solution:**
- Added smart timer logic (2-minute cooldown)
- Quick replies now only show when needed:
  - On first contact (GET_STARTED)
  - After completing advance order
  - When customer sends unrecognized text (with cooldown)
- **NOT shown** after viewing menu, foodpanda, location, contact, or hours
- Quick replies are persistent in Messenger UI anyway, so customers can always tap them

### 2. Easy Store Hours Management
**Problem:** Needed to deploy code every time store hours changed

**Solution:**
- Created `config.json` for all configurable settings
- Auto-reload feature detects file changes
- Changes apply within 1-2 minutes without server restart
- No code deployment needed!

## 📝 New Features

### 1. Special Closure Dates
- Add dates when store will be closed (holidays, events, etc.)
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` in the `closed_dates` array
- Example: `["2025-12-25", "2026-01-01"]`

### 2. Config Auto-Reload
- Bot checks if `config.json` was modified
- Automatically reloads new settings
- No server restart required

### 3. All Settings in One Place
Now in `config.json`:
- ⏰ Store hours (open/close times)
- 📞 Contact phone number
- 🔗 URLs (Foodpanda, Menu image, Google Maps)
- 🚫 Special closure dates

## 🎯 Quick Edits Examples
